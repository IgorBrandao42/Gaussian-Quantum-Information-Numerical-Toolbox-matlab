# Gaussian Quantum State Toolbox

This is a MATLAB Toolbox for numerical simulation of quantum gaussian states and their dynamics dictated by a set of linear Langevin and Lyapunov equations


In regards to the numerical Gaussian Quantum Information portion of this toolbox, given a gaussian state's expected quadratures and/or covariance matrix, it calculates:
Its wigner function, von Neumann entropy, logarithmic negaitivy, mutual information, its covariance matrix's symplectic_eigenvalues and single mode partitions and bipartitions. Given two arbitrary gaussian states, it also computes their quantum fidelity. For the full description and notation used for gaussian quantum states, please refere to [[Rev. Mod. Phys. 84, 621]](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.84.621). For the quantum fidelity, see [[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 260501]](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.260501).

## Installation

Clone this repository or download this Toolbox and add its main folder to the MATLAB path:

```MATLAB
addpath('<download-path>/<name-folder>');
```

## Usage

This program only inputs are the parameters values and time interval for the calculation. The program infers the number of particles from the lengths of these vectors.
```MATLAB
% Define the constants for the system under study (in this case 3 particles and one cavity)
omega =    2*pi*[305.4e+3;  305.4e+3;  305.4e+3];     % Natural frequency of the particles [Hz]
g     =    2*pi*[ 64.0e+3;   93.2e+3;  109.2e+3];     % Coupling strength                  [Hz]
gamma =    2*pi*[ 9.57e-4;   9.57e-4;   9.57e-4];     % Damping                            [Hz]
T     =         [ 4.6e-6;    4.6e-6;     4.6e-6];     % Initial temperature of each particle             [K]
T_environment = [   300 ;       300;        300];     % Temperature for the environment of each particle [K]

Delta = 2*pi*315e+3;                                  % Cavity-tweezer detuning            [Hz] (frequency of the optical mode)
kappa = 2*pi*193e+3;                                  % Cavity linewidth                   [Hz]

t = linspace(0, 4.2e-6, 1e+3);                        % Time interval for the simulation   [s]
```

You need to create an instance of a simulation (class) with the parameters and run the calculations at the time stamps:
```MATLAB
% Create an instance of a simulation
example = simulation(omega, g, gamma, T, T_environment, Delta, kappa);

% Run the every calculation available
example.run(t);
```

The simulations are a handle class and its results can be directly extracted or plotted using its internal plotting methods:
```MATLAB
% Plot the results
example.plot();
```

The user can choose to calculate only what suits them, by passing extra parameters to the method 'run', they are:

|  Optional parameter  | Specific calculation of time evolution |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| "langevin"           | Solve semiclassical Langevin equations for the expectation value of the quadratures |
| "lyapunov"           | Solve Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix| 
| "steady_state"       | Find steady state covariance matrix |
|"occupation_number"   | Find the occupation number for each mode|
| "entanglement"       | Calculate the logarithmic negativity for each bipartition |
| "entropy"            | Calculate the von Neumann entropy for each mode, bipartition and the whole system|
| "mutual_information" | Calculate the mutual information for the whole system|
| "fidelity_test"      | Approximate each mode state by a thermal state through Fideliy, finding the effective temperature |

```MATLAB
% Run a specific calculation
example.run(t, "occupation_number");
```

#### Running Example
